Lab 0 Week 1 and Week 2 files

square.py:
Program used to familiarize with the lab microcontroller. The code turns a pin on and off and generates a corresponding square wave to be viewed on an oscilloscope.


step_response.py:
Program generates the step response voltage values of an RC circuit and prints the values vs. time in the shell window for estimated values between 0.0 and 3.3V. 


lab0_week2V3.py:
Program takes the recorded values from step_response.py and creates an appropriate matlibplot that graphs the values and compares them to a theoretical curve.
